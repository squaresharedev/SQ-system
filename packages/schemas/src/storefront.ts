// The Storefront feature contract: the seller's bento canvas + theme, stored
// as jsonb in `storefronts.config` and validated by storefront-validation.ts
// (the single source of truth) on every write. The future buyer-facing embed
// renders this exact shape — keep it renderable as typed React data only (no
// HTML, no URLs, no free-form CSS anywhere in it). The one non-visual member
// is `embed` (widget settings; hostname-regex-gated) — the public embed
// serializer must STRIP it and must drop blocks hidden by
// `theme.hideSoldOut` before anything leaves the owner's session.
//
// Type aliases (not interfaces) on purpose: aliases get TypeScript's implicit
// index signature, so the config assigns cleanly to Supabase's `Json`.
//
// PACKAGE NOTE: this file is SQ-store's types/storefront.ts (free-placement
// canvas model), exported as-is. Keep the two in lockstep until SQ-store
// consumes this package directly.
